In this folder, you can find code that was used to add additional species. The code serves as an orientation as for the addition of a new species many steps need to be done manually. However, in [create_table_XX_dataset.Rmd](create_table_XX_dataset.Rmd) one can find a guide for adding a new species.

For orientation purposes, you can find a detailed description for every column of the *table_XX_Dataset.rds* below. The *table_XX_Non_Listed_Proteins.rds* columns are identical, except for the column identifying the proteins as RBPs or non-RBPs.
