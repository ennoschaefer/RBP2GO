# Welcome to the RBP2GO database repository

Graphic
-----------------------------
Generally speaking, the database is based on big datasets for each species. To get an overview, take a look at this graphic:

Structure of this repository
-----------------------------
Fabio's code is the file datamerger_final.py
In the RBDs_analysis_script_V2 folder is Elsas code to analyze the data and Ennos code which is to add species. Enno followed Elsas structure and added his files to her directories. For now, the data_maintenance subdirectory is not in use and just added for future analysis/structure.


Data 
-----------------------------
All the necessary data is to be put in the folders "Input" and "Output", which have have to be subdirectories of the RBD_analaysis_script_V2 folder. Enno put all this data on an USB stick which he passed to Maiwen.
